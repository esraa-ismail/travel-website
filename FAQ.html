                    <strong>1. What is the official currency in Egypt?
                    </strong> <br> - The official currency of Egypt is the Egyptian pound, or “Geneh” in Arabic, and commonly abbreviated as LE. One Egyptian pound is 100 piastres, or "irsh" in Arabic. There are banknotes of 1, 5,
                    10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 LE and there are coins of 25 piastres, 50 piastres, and 1 pound. It can sometimes be difficult to find change for large bills so it is always advisable to have change on hand for taxis and tips. <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>2. Will I be able to exchange dollars, Euros, or other currencies in Egypt?
                    </strong> <br>- There are a large number of banks and exchange offices that can change cash and travelers’ checks in Egypt. Moreover, many touristic shops, restaurants, and bars will actually accept dollars or Euros
                    at rates that are relatively close to the official ones. Makes sure you know the current exchange rate of dollars or Euros to Egyptian pounds.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>3. How common is the use of credit cards in Egypt?
                    </strong> <br>- Credit cards are widely used in Egypt in hotels, many shops, restaurants, and cafes. Most stores in markets like Khan El Khalili and the Luxor touristic market accept credit cards. The most common
                    types of credit cards used in Egypt are Visa, Master Card, and American Express.

                    <strong>1. Is it a good idea to take the train from Cairo to distant destinations in Egypt like Aswan?
                    </strong> <br> - Generally speaking, the standard of the railways service in Egypt is pretty good. The Egyptian railway network connects the Nile Valley, the Delta, and the Suez Canal. In the summer there are also
                    trains to the resort areas along Egypt’s Mediterranean coast. <br> - Because of the high prices of domestic flights in Egypt, air travel does not always suit budget travelers. While it takes longer, train travel provides a cheaper
                    option and the experience of seeing the entire Nile Valley by train is a memorable one. The sleeper trains from Cairo to Aswan and Luxor are designed specifically for tourists, leaving Cairo at 9 PM and arriving in Luxor at around
                    4 AM and in Aswan around 7 AM. These trains are comfortable and the guests will be offered a private cabin and a hot dinner. <br> -Bus travel is also available to all of these locations for Turgoman Bus Station, located near the main
                    train station in Downtown Cairo. Buses provide another affordable travel option.
